*DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED* :

1. *Data Loading*: We use FileDataModel to load the user-item interaction data from a CSV file (data.csv).
2. *LogLikelihoodSimilarity*: The log-likelihood is, as the term suggests, the natural logarithm of the likelihood.
3. *NearestUserNeighborhood*:  K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to perform classification and regression tasks.
4. *GenericUserBasedRecommender*: A simple Recommender which uses a given DataModel and UserNeighborhood to produce recommendations.
5. *UserNeighborhood*: Implementations of this interface compute a "neighborhood" of users like a given user. This neighborhood can be used to compute recommendations then.
6. *RecommendedItem*: Implementations encapsulate items that are recommended, and include the item recommended and a value expressing the strength of the preference.
