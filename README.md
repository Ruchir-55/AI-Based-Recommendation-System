*DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED* :

1. *Data Loading*: We use FileDataModel to load the user-item interaction data from a CSV file (data.csv).
2. *User Similarity*: The PearsonCorrelationSimilarity class is used to measure similarity between users. Pearson correlation is a common method used in collaborative filtering for similarity measurement.
3. *Recommender*: We use the GenericUserBasedRecommender which recommends items for users based on their similarity to other users.
4. *Recommendations*: The recommend method generates top-N recommendations (3 items in this example) for a given user (userId = 1).
5. *Display Recommendations*: Finally, the program prints out the recommended items for the specified user, showing the item ID and the predicted rating.
